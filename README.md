# Introduction

Before we get started, I'm stoked for the opportunity to work at Netlify! I know that looking through homework can be a slog sometimes, we had a double blind hiring process at Compose - but we also brought on some really talented and skilled people!

Note that this [Gitbook space](https://zorroheater-project.gitbook.io/netlify-homework-ross-fisher) is synced to [https://github.com/zorrobyte/netlify-homework-md](https://github.com/zorrobyte/netlify-homework-md) which auto pushes to a Netlify space at [https://remarkable-dodol-d10961.netlify.app/#/README](https://remarkable-dodol-d10961.netlify.app/#/README)

Cool, right?

Note that the Netlify version of this docs repo has broken images and this documentation is intended to be viewed on [Gitbook](https://zorroheater-project.gitbook.io/netlify-homework-ross-fisher) (Gitbook stores the image assets in a `.gitbook` folder at root, which Netlify is currently unable to resolve).

I could spend a bit more time getting images working and pretty up the Netlify site (I used [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) for the frontend) - but sticking to the instructed ethos of:

* _Weâ€™re not going to be judging your web design skills. We will be judging how you approach the work as well as looking for thoughtful answers to the questions._
{% endhint %}

I'll aim to make this process as engaging (and a little fun) as possible for you. Let's get started!

(And if you are curious as to this domain's root, it was for some docs I was building for this little ESP32 project: [https://github.com/zorrobyte/esp32-universal-diesel-heater-controller](https://github.com/zorrobyte/esp32-universal-diesel-heater-controller) - I received a free plan from GitBook for it, so I just went with it for this exercise)
