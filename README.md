# Introduction

Before we get started, I'm stoked for the opportunity to work at Netlify! I know that looking through homework can be a slog sometimes, we had a double blind hiring process at Compose - but we also brought on some really talented and skilled people!

I'll aim to make this process as engaging (and a little fun) as possible for you. Let's get started!

(And if you are curious as to this domain's root, it was for some docs I was building for this little ESP32 project: [https://github.com/zorrobyte/esp32-universal-diesel-heater-controller](https://github.com/zorrobyte/esp32-universal-diesel-heater-controller) - I received a free plan from GitBook for it, so I just went with it for this exercise)
