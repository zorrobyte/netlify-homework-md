# Initial Product Feedback

First off, 5 Million Devs is genuinely a treat. I was fully expecting a link to a static blog with a healthy dose of marketing contentâ„¢, but this minigame is (chef's kiss). It genuinely got me excited in the company, and led to submitting my resume, so hats off to the team!

With in mind I've never used Netlify, I created an account last week and deployed your ThanosJS Example (I got a laugh out of that). My first thought approaching the homework was how do I delete my content and start over?

Objectively impressive, or at least, impressive after using Fin within Intercom. The chatbot was able to successfully utilize RAG to bring me the needed information. The only possible questionable choice was to focus on the CLI and Endpoint, as a brand new user - may shift my mindset away from return on invested time/initial ease of use.

I did manage to find the "Danger zone" on my own in the Site configuration:

I could go either way as to if this is valid feedback. Introduction of the CLI and API not only advertises these features, but it may also help set the expectation of the product - not exactly aimed for your typical GoDaddy WYSIWYG user, which is fine. However, a docs link in the search or reply from the chatbot to simply go to Site Settings>Delete site is what I was ideally expecting.
