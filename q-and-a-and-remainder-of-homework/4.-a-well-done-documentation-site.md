# 4. A well done documentation site

> Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and explain why you think they are well done.

Very much a biased answer here, but I convinced my CEO at Kubecost to allow me to take on building a docs team and completely re-vamping Kubecost's docs within three months of joining:

{% embed url="https://docs.kubecost.com" %}

It was certiantly a team effort, and I loved giving kudos publicly to those on the docs team in our shoutouts channel. While I certainly think there are areas for improvement, such as the structure and content being a bear to categorize within neat, easily navigable sections (the product is rather complex), I'm proud of the work I was able to get done (and see that they finally got doc versioning live, awesome work!)

Specifics wins were:

* We had a mess of internal docs spread in GDrive (with broken permissions), Google Sites, Github, you name it. Having a single source of truth greatly increased productivity and discoverability of our team's knowledge
* We had non-technical users who didn't know how to write markdown or push to Git, Gitbook solved this with a slick interface that was easy to use, yet, provided a backend PR workflow in source markdown so engineering didn't have to deviate from the muscle memory of their processes
* Auditing, rollback, compliance, and so on helped us meet our SOC2 certification
* It's much prettier, maintainable, and secure than our previous homebrew bubblegum docs portal (and I didn't have to manually translate word docs/gdocs to markdown and manually maintain it anymore, huzza!)
