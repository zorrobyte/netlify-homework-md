# 9. Security Vulnerabilities

> We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on[ www.netlify.com](http://www.netlify.com/). You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?

Sweet, we have a bug bounty program!

I can also infer much about our internal procedures here, and provide a good assumption based upon best practices:

Hey, Dave!

Thank you for bringing this potential security issue to our attention. Security is a top priority for us at Netlify, and we take all reports very seriously. We’re committed to a thorough investigation to ensure the continued safety and integrity of our platform. To begin, our security team will carefully review the details you've provided and attempt to substantiate the report. We'll be looking closely at any relevant logs and monitoring data, as well as involving other team members as necessary to allocate all possible resources towards investigating this issue.

We appreciate your concern for our platform’s security and want to assure you that we’re treating this with urgency. While we work to confirm and assess the scope, we’re committed to full transparency and responsible disclosure, in line with Netlify’s security policies. We’ll keep you updated on our progress and any actions we take in response to your findings.

Since this issue could potentially be severe, we’re notifying key internal stakeholders, including our Chief Information Security Officer, and escalating this matter across our security and engineering teams. If we confirm that this is a critical vulnerability, we’ll follow our 48-hour notification policy to inform customers as needed. Thank you for helping us ensure the safety of our platform and community. We’ll stay in touch as we move forward with our investigation.

Being that Support recently moved under Netlify's Cybersecurity team, I'd assume that there are specific runbooks and processes to follow. My first step would be to immediately consult internal documentation, if not already familiar, and consult with my lead or manager if in anyway unsure how to proceed with the report.

We are indeed assuming that the vulnerability may be severe so there isn't much time to mess about trying to replicate the issue on my own and hold up the processes needed to actually investigate at a deep level and resolve.

Of course, I've had my fair share of random passerby's in the support queue send automated vulnerability scanning tool reports in also, so it's important to have a little sense as to security so we aren't bugging Mark Dorsi with a minor request either.
