# 8. Deploy a function

> Please attempt to deploy a[ function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) on our service. This need not be complicated. It could be "Hello World". Note that failure to deploy is not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot any issues you encountered.

_This need not be complicated.._ Oh. :sweat\_smile:&#x20;

Here's my express backend that I refactored for deployment on Netlify:

{% embed url="https://github.com/zorrobyte/blog-js-project/blob/netlify/backend/api.js" %}

And as I'm sure you are aware of by now:

{% content-ref url="../baby-steps-initial-deployment/" %}
[baby-steps-initial-deployment](../baby-steps-initial-deployment/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
