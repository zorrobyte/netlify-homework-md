# 7. Redirects and proxies

> How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to[ https://www.google.com/search?q=anything](https://www.google.com/search?q=anything). Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site.

HTTP 301 Status Redirect:

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "/netlify/:query"
  to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=:query"
  status = 301
  force = true
```

* **from**: Matches any path starting with `/netlify/` followed by any text (captured as `:query`)
* **to**: Redirects to `https://www.google.com/search?q=:query`, where `:query` is dynamically replaced with whatever comes after `/netlify/`
* **status**: `301` ensures a permanent redirect
* **force**: Ensures this redirect will override any existing routes

Proxy Redirect:

* **status**: `200` indicates a proxy, allowing the request to pass through Netlify to the destination
* **proxy**: `true` enables proxying behavior, so the user remains on your domain (they won’t see `google.com` in their address bar)
