1. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before **(it's fun learning new things!)**
2. Join a Zoom call with a VIP customer you have been helping via email, upon their request **(I miss being on-call when at IBM; suprised and delighted American Airlines, Mercedes-Benz, and many other Fortune 50 companies, sometimes at 2AM on Christmas Eve!)**
3. Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes **(anything that we can do to reduce pain for one customer and drive the business need quickly amplifies to all customers as they won't experience the bug)**
4. Help train and onboard new support teammates **(let's always challenge ourselves to raise each other up and be open to giving and receiving feedback)**
5. Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers **(while I feel as if this activity would be most driven by the CS team/account owners, and/or project managers to gauge and drive business need, support is an invaluable resource for engineering to share customer sentiment and needs. Actual dev work and PRs? Let's do it!)**
6. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model **(I championed our sales collaboration runbooks in support at Kubecost, we realized a measurable uptick in sales as we had a free tier, and sales LOVED the help getting customers in the funnel!)**
7. Set up your own copy of several site frameworks for debugging **(I'm running out of numbers, but I pair this in with my first ranking of debugging a language and framework I've never seen before!)**

Edit: `List 5 things that are your most favorite to do and 5 things that are least favorite.`

I'm a little embarrased that I got carried away and assumed I was doing an overall ranking from most to least favorite, my bad! A part of my work ethos of problem solving and self correction is working out in the open and being open to feedback, so I'll leave the above section in these docs and self correct!\


## 5 Least Favorite Activities

1. Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter (Considering I'll be Enterprise Focused, this is an easy least favorite (and a bit of a cop out) as [what major brands are left on X](https://sensortower.com/blog/top-advertisers-flee-x-twitter-amidst-continued-controversy)?)
2. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case (While I'm certainly soft-skills focused and have a unique personality blend of social+deep tech knowledge, I'm a little camera shy for recorded content potentially tens of thousands of people would see. I can get it done and even enjoy it, but expect a week lead-time to implement a new skincare routine as the dry skin is real this fall)
3. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before (This one is hard to incude in the list, but as I must provide five. Reasoning being, I'm unsure as to the caseload metric day-to-day on the team and balancing deep work while maintaining productivity metrics can be a balancing act. I personally love learning and would collaborate with my manager, if I felt it was needed, for a few hours of focus time during my shift to go deep, then document any findings for the team and end users to make next time easier for us)
4. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems (I have much experience at Apple working chat for iOS/macOS back in the day and was very good at it! Reasoning for inclusion on this list is that customers are usually directed to cases when issues become complex, and I'd prefer to spend time debugging and going deep on complex issues, as that's where I find the most rewarding work. Of course, open to doing both if we need coverage!)
5. Suggest and champion improvements to the Support team's workflow (A core tenant of my objectives at work is to think about automating the boring stuff. Small improvements—such as auto-filling fields with data already in our database or streamlining case workflows to eliminate unnecessary steps—may seem minor. However, even a 5-second manual task, repeated over 30 cases daily, adds up to 50 minutes a month, costing $718 per agent annually in lost productivity (assuming a Sr. Support Engineer salary). With each additional inefficiency, these costs skyrocket, quickly leading to substantial productivity and financial losses, and reduced QoL in support. I'm including this on the list just as I must provide five and sometimes getting buy-in for seemingly minor enhancements, from hard won experience, can be difficult sometimes)

## 5 Most Favorite Activities

1. Join a Zoom call with a VIP customer you have been helping via email, upon their request **(I miss being on-call when at IBM; suprised and delighted American Airlines, Mercedes-Benz, and many other Fortune 50 companies, sometimes at 2AM on Christmas Eve!)**
2. Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes **(anything that we can do to reduce pain for one customer and drive the business need quickly amplifies to all customers as they won't experience the bug)**
3. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model **(I championed our sales collaboration runbooks in support at Kubecost, we realized a measurable uptick in sales as we had a free tier, I personally felt rewarded helping close $100,000 one month, and sales LOVED the help getting customers in the funnel! Setting proper expectations is also core to a world-class support team)**
4. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before **(This is also on my other list, I love learning new things!)**
5. Set up your own copy of several site frameworks for debugging **(It's fun to learn, as I did creating this docsite, it's also critial to maintain enviorments where issues can be replicated and confirmed, expecially before escalating to engineering)**
